🔧 How It Works
Radio Buttons as Triggers – Hidden radio inputs control which planet is active.

CSS Selectors – :checked selectors change perspective, opacity, and visibility.

3D Animations – transform: translateZ() creates depth, combined with rotation for orbit effects.

Textures – Planet previews use background images mapped from space imagery.
